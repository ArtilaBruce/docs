# Artila Unveils New Future-Proof IIoT Gateway for AI-Driven Applications

Artila Electronics is proud to announce the upcoming release of the Matrix-900, a cutting-edge embedded computing platform designed for advanced Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) applications. Leveraging the powerful **Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4**, the Matrix-900 is engineered to meet the demands of modern industrial environments with superior performance, flexibility, and reliability.

The Matrix-900 is powered by a **quad-core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC** running at **1.5GHz**, offering a choice of over 10 different variants of the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 family, with options ranging from 1GB to 8GB of DDR RAM and 8GB to 32GB of eMMC storage. This versatile platform ensures that the Matrix-900 can be tailored to suit a wide variety of IIoT applications. 

## Key Hardware Highlights and Benefits
### 1. M.2 B Key Expansion Slot with PCIe Interface
The Matrix-900 supports expansion through its M.2 B Key slot, allowing for the integration of SSD modules, 5G communication modules, and **AI inference accelerators** such as the Hailo 8 and Hailo 8L. These AI modules offer powerful edge computing capabilities, with the Hailo 8 delivering up to 26 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second) and the Hailo 8L providing up to 13 TOPS. This significantly enhances the system’s ability to handle complex AI workloads directly at the edge, making the Matrix-900 a robust platform for AI-driven IIoT applications.

### 2. Fanless Design with Efficient Heat Dissipation
The Matrix-900 features a fanless design that ensures silent operation. By utilizing a high-efficiency thermal pad, the heat generated by the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is effectively transferred to the metal chassis of the Matrix-900. This design facilitates rapid heat convection, allowing the CPU to consistently run at its full 1.5GHz frequency without heat-related issues, thereby enhancing system stability and ensuring continuous 24/7 operation.
### 3. Dual Ethernet Ports and Four RS-485 Serial Ports
Ideal for acting as an IIoT Gateway, the Matrix-900 excels at data acquisition and protocol conversion, seamlessly connecting cloud services with on-premise devices.
### 4. MiniPCIe Expansion Slot with USB 2.0 Interface
This slot allows for the integration of LTE/4G and WiFi modules, providing versatile wireless connectivity options.
### 5. Comprehensive Connectivity: 
With one HDMI port, two USB host ports, and an audio out port, the Matrix-900 can easily connect to monitors, keyboards, and mice, facilitating straightforward operation of Raspberry Pi OS with desktop, along with high-quality stereo audio output.
### 6. Compact and Flexible Installation: 
Measuring just 45x166x120mm, the Matrix-900’s compact size supports both DIN rail and wall-mount installation. Its upright design not only saves space but also simplifies cable management and antenna adjustments, making it an ideal fit for various industrial environments.

### More Infomation
The Matrix-900 is set to officially launch in Q4. For detailed specifications and more information, please refer to the [Datasheet (draft)](datasheet.md).

With the Matrix-900, Artila Electronics continues to push the boundaries of IIoT innovation, offering a versatile and high-performance solution tailored for the AI-driven industrial landscape.
